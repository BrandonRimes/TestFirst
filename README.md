## Spec

## TODO

- Allow users to add books.
  - MODEL
    - Title
    - Author
    - Genre
    - Fiction (bool)
    - Checked in/out (bool)

- Allow users to check out books.

- Allow users to view a list of books.

- Allow users to return books.

## Lab

Design a simple API for a public library using TDD methodologies. This will be a partnered lab, where one person writes the tests and the other implements the functionality.

This lab is intentionally open ended, you can implement whatever features you like into this API. However you have to meet a deadline, remember KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)

Steps:

- Create a repository on GitHub where you and your partner will push code

- Create a specification (together) for what your library API needs to do

- Write this up in a markdown file in your repo called SPEC.md

- Use the spec to keep track of your work, sort of like a checklist

This will include a description of the functionality and general layout of the routes you'll need (CRUDL?)

- Follow the red green pattern:

Write a failing test

Write the code that will make it pass

- Ensure your test coverage is above 85%
